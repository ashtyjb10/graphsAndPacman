Assignment 8: List_2420: README 
Ashton Schmidt
I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write
this program (such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely
manner).  I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or
recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other than the lecture that I used to
help write the code are cited in my work.  When working with a partner, I have
contributed an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  Further, I have
helped write all the code assigned as pair-programming and reviewed all code that
was written separately. (Ashton Schmidt)


This code is well commented and should tell you everything that you need to know. But just
in case the code takes in a maze file, and then makes a matrix out of the characters from 
the file. It then creates a matrix of nodes, and an array of the nodes. The array is then
passed into a Breadth first solver that places '.' in the matrix for the path backwards. It 
then writes a text file that saves to Resources1 (you may have to refresh in order to see).

We did not include our test cases because the assignment didn't state to do so. If
they are needed we can send you them as soon as possible!

Thank you!!
